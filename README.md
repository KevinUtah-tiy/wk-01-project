Synopsis

This is our first project at The Iron Yard.  We are to create a webpage for a fictitious business, Betty's Best Ice Cream.  It needs to following:  shop's name; a brief history (able to use lorem ipsum); a logo (any image that can find online); store's hours and contact information; and, available flavors (between 5 and 42 with name, calorie count and whether is is sugar free or not and a link to a wikipedia for that flavor)

Code Example

None

Motivation

The motivation for this project is simple.  I am paying a lot of money to change careers and make a better life for my wife and me.  I want to put the best product out that I know how to currently make.
